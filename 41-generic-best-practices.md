# 🚧​ Generic Best Practices

### Architectural Practices

- **Domain‑Driven Design**: Model microservices around business domains and bounded contexts.
- **Event‑Driven Architecture**: Use events to decouple services, enabling asynchronous processing and improved scalability.
- **Circuit Breaker and Retry Patterns**: Implement resilience to transient failures.
- **API Versioning**: Design APIs with versioning to enable backward compatibility.
- **Idempotency**: Ensure operations can be safely retried without side effects.
- **Observability & Telemetry**: Build instrumentation into services from day one (metrics, logs, traces).
- **Security by Design**: Incorporate security across all layers (network, application, data). Use threat modeling and regularly update dependencies.

### Development Practices

- Use test‑driven development (TDD) and continuous integration; unit, integration and end‑to‑end tests.
- Adopt GitOps: treat configuration as code, manage via pull requests, ensure reproducibility and audit trails.
- Use semantic versioning; follow trunk‑based development for rapid iteration.

### Operations Practices

- Use infrastructure as code (Ansible, Terraform, CloudFormation) to manage clusters and environment; ensure reproducibility.
- Use automated pipelines for build, test, deployment and verification; incorporate security scanning and policy checks.
- Use autoscaling to handle variable workloads; design for failure by simulating outages (chaos engineering).
- Implement robust monitoring, alerting and incident response; use runbooks and SLOs/SLAs.
- Review costs regularly; optimize resource consumption (right‑size instances, leverage reserved instances, use serverless where appropriate).

### Team Practices

- Foster cross‑functional teams owning services end to end (development, deployment, operation).
- Encourage documentation and knowledge sharing; maintain architecture diagrams, runbooks and READMEs.
- Leverage retrospectives to improve processes and design; adopt an Agile mindset.
